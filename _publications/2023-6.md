Deep learning (DL) and other types of artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly used in many biomedical areas, including genetics. One frequent use in medical genetics involves evaluating images of people with potential genetic conditions to help with diagnosis. A central question involves better understanding how AI classifiers assess images compared to humans. To explore this, we performed eye-tracking analyses of geneticist clinicians and non-clinicians. We compared results to DL-based saliency maps. We found that human visual attention when assessing images differs greatly from the parts of images weighted by the DL model. Further, individuals tend to have a specific pattern of image inspection, and clinicians demonstrate different visual attention patterns than non-clinicians.
