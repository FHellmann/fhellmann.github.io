title: "INTERACTIVE MACHINE LEARNING TO ENHANCE STUDENTS'UNDERSTANDING AND SATISFACTION APPLYING THE LEARNING BY DOING METHODOLOGY"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-IMLTESASATLBDM
excerpt: "In the context of contemporary education, traditional pedagogical approaches based on passively attending lectures often prove inadequate in engaging learners who are increasingly immersed in a dynamic, technology-driven environment. To address the needs of this generation effectively, it is essential to invest efforts in improving instructional and tailored strategies that accommodate diverse learning styles and incorporate state-of-the-art technological advancements. The necessity of acquiring a basic knowledge of the subject matter and the need for experiential learning can be addressed through a combination of the ''flipped classroom'' methodology and projects that emphasize the ''learning by doing'' approach.  In the Interactive Machine Learning course, online lectures are combined with guided exercises and projects in the classroom, allowing students to apply the learned concepts as they fit [...]"
