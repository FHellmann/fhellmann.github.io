collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-7
excerpt: " INTRODUCTION: We aimed to (1) characterize the spectrum of clinical phenotypes of NF1 in a random pediatric population, (2) correlate genotype with phenotypic expression for those with a genetic diagnosis, and (3) explore radiological features of NF1 in the central nervous system (CNS) by radiomics analyses to predict clinical course. METHODS: We performed a database search in the hospital information system of the University Children's Hospital between January 2017 and December 2020 for patients with NF1 and evaluated the clinical phenotype by retrospective chart review. RESULTS: 75 children/adolescents were identified with suspicion/clinical diagnosis of NF1 (median age 10.0 years (range, 1 [...]"

 INTRODUCTION: We aimed to (1) characterize the spectrum of clinical phenotypes of NF1 in a random pediatric population, (2) correlate genotype with phenotypic expression for those with a genetic diagnosis, and (3) explore radiological features of NF1 in the central nervous system (CNS) by radiomics analyses to predict clinical course. METHODS: We performed a database search in the hospital information system of the University Children's Hospital between January 2017 and December 2020 for patients with NF1 and evaluated the clinical phenotype by retrospective chart review. RESULTS: 75 children/adolescents were identified with suspicion/clinical diagnosis of NF1 (median age 10.0 years (range, 1.1-22.6); 35 female), confirmatory revised ''diagnostic criteria'' were met in 57 patients at the last follow-up. Per number of documented items, major signs were detected as 73/75 caf&eacute;-au-lait ...
