Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated its effectiveness by achieving human-level performance in various complex tasks, including the biomedical field. Cancer research, adapting to a fast-changing world, is leveraging AI as a promising framework to better understand tumor development. Moreover, current AI methods can help predict more suitable and personalized treatment strategies for specific types of tumors. We explored AI methods applied to Neurofibromatosis Type 1, focusing on glial tumors. Additionally, we have reviewed all publicly available datasets to date. Discussion of future challenges is highly desirable since Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is one of the most common hereditary tumor syndromes and is associated with an increased rate of glial tumors as well as a reduced life expectancy due to malignancy.
