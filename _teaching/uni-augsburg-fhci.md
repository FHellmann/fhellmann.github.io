This course focuses on "Foundations of Human-Computer Interaction".

Content of the course:
* Interaction forms and metaphors
* recognition and interpretation of user input
* generation and synchronization of system outputs
* multimodal dialog systems
* user and discourse modeling
* agent-based multimodal interaction
* evaluation of multimodal user interfaces
* next-generation user interfaces (perceptual interfaces, emotional interfaces, human-robot interaction, etc.)

My contribution to the course has been giving the lecture on "Gesture Recognition" and correct the exam exercise about this topic.
